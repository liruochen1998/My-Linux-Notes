reference: https://blog.csdn.net/webyzx/article/details/78666344 (very useful)

1. install apps
yum install -y httpd php php-fpm mysql mysql-server php-mysql  

2. start the apps
service httpd start
service mysqld start  
service php-fpm start  

3. visit the ip to check

4. mysql setup

5. wordpress:
wget http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz  

mkdir /var/blog  

tar –zxf latest.tar.gz -C /var/blog  

chown –R apache:apache /var/blog  

setup the environment:
/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf (however, I use the directory /etc/httpd/httpd.conf instead, which is the LAMP setup directory)

add:
<VirtualHost *:80>  
    ServerName 域名  
    DocumentRoot "/var/blog/wordpress"  
    <Directory "/var/blog/wordpress">  
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks  
        AllowOverride None        
        Order deny,allow  
        Allow from all  
    </Directory>  
    ErrorLog logs/blog-error.log  
    CustomLog logs/blog-access.log common  
  
</VirtualHost>  

restart and visit the ip



When I visit the ip, I need to setup the database in wordpress. 
The info is in wp-config.php

At first, I can't connect to the database and all the solution doesn't work. 
Then I deleted the database, which is the latest mariaDB and installed the aliyun mysql, which is version 5.7. And it worked.

Also, when I use mariaDB, the myphpadmin doesn't work, but when I use 5.7 mysql,the phpmyadmin works.
