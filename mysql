login mysql:

without password:
mysql

with password:
mysql -u root -p
and then type in the password

install mysql instruction:

at the very first time, I refer to https://blog.csdn.net/u011019141/article/details/51280599, but it didn't work well. 

1. download mysql and send it to your server.
2. install mysql in /usr/local/mysql
3. in terminal, try to run "mysql" but it didn't work: 
ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock' (2)  

in the website, it says that we can solve it using:
service mysql start  
/etc/init.d/mysql start  

but it seems that these two does not work for me and they report the same error, and I tried a really long time, finding a solution for it.

I downloaded mariaDB, after searching, we can consider it as a new version of mysql.

then I refer to this site: https://www.cnblogs.com/lushengle/p/7607953.html (perhaps, something like this)

yum install -y mariadb-server
systemctl start mariadb.service
systemctl enable mariadb.service
// the other two steps I didn't try

then I refer to this site: https://blog.csdn.net/ghost_leader/article/details/53366942

at this time, if I type in "mysql", I will be in the mariaDB service but other command seems not work well.

1. start mariadb
systemctl start mariadb
2. change password
mysqladmin -uroot -p password your-password
(and press enter when it says "Enter password:)
3. log in mariadb using password
mysql -u root -p
at this time, only using "mysql" won't work.

(further questions refer to this site, very useful)


Update:
I had problem registing wordpress, connecting to the database error, so I install mysql again, using version 5.7 from aliyun instruction: https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/50774.html?spm=a2c4g.11186623.6.766.LgY4mw

1. check whether you have installed mariaDB or mySQL:
rpm -qa | grep mysql
rpm -qa | grep mariadb

2. delete the current version:
rpm -e 软件名    #注意：这里的软件名必须包含软件的版本信息，如rpm -e mariadb-libs-5.5.52-1.el7.x86_64。一般使用此命令即可卸载成功。
rpm -e --nodeps 软件名   #卸载不成功时使用此命令强制卸载

3. install mySQL again:
yum install -y libaio-*                         #安装依赖
mkdir -p /usr/local/mysql
cd /usr/local/src
wget http://zy-res.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/mysql/mysql-5.7.17-linux-glibc2.5-x86_64.tar.gz 
tar -xzvf mysql-5.7.17-linux-glibc2.5-x86_64.tar.gz
mv mysql-5.7.17-linux-glibc2.5-x86_64/* /usr/local/mysql/

4. add user and group:
groupadd mysql
useradd -g mysql -s /sbin/nologin mysql

5. initialize the database:
/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld --initialize-insecure --datadir=/usr/local/mysql/data/ --user=mysql

6. add authority:
chown -R mysql:mysql /usr/local/mysql

7. setup autostart:
cd /usr/local/mysql/support-files/
cp mysql.server  /etc/init.d/mysqld
chmod +x /etc/init.d/mysqld             # 添加执行权限
vim /etc/rc.d/rc.local
add /etc/init.d/mysqld start in it.

8. setup environment:
vi /root/.bash_profile
将 PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:/usr/local/apache/bin 修改为 PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:/usr/local/apache/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:/usr/local/mysql/bin。
说明：此处是在编译安装 Apache的环境变量的基础上再进行修改。

source /root/.bash_profile

9. start mySQL:
/etc/init.d/mysqld start

10. setup the password and the following steps...
