login mysql:

without password:
mysql

with password:
mysql -u root -p
and then type in the password

install mysql instruction:

at the very first time, I refer to https://blog.csdn.net/u011019141/article/details/51280599, but it didn't work well. 

1. download mysql and send it to your server.
2. install mysql in /usr/local/mysql
3. in terminal, try to run "mysql" but it didn't work: 
ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock' (2)  

in the website, it says that we can solve it using:
service mysql start  
/etc/init.d/mysql start  

but it seems that these two does not work for me and they report the same error, and I tried a really long time, finding a solution for it.

I downloaded mariaDB, after searching, we can consider it as a new version of mysql.

then I refer to this site: https://www.cnblogs.com/lushengle/p/7607953.html (perhaps, something like this)

yum install -y mariadb-server
systemctl start mariadb.service
systemctl enable mariadb.service
// the other two steps I didn't try

then I refer to this site: https://blog.csdn.net/ghost_leader/article/details/53366942

at this time, if I type in "mysql", I will be in the mariaDB service but other command seems not work well.

1. start mariadb
systemctl start mariadb
2. change password
mysqladmin -uroot -p password your-password
(and press enter when it says "Enter password:)
3. log in mariadb using password
mysql -u root -p
at this time, only using "mysql" won't work.

(further questions refer to this site, very useful)
